Hello..<br>
I'm still a beginner in using react,<br>
but I want to always learn to react native and react js.<br>
If there are still many shortcomings in this currency application,<br>
please help me to fix it to be perfect according to your request.. <br>Thank you<br>
If you want to run it using a docker, please check the code below<br>
<b>docker container run -it -p 3000:3000 myproject:rk</b>
<br>

Happy to do the test that you give, so that I will be eager to learn better ...
